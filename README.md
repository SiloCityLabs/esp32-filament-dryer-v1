# **DIY Filament Dryer â€“ ESP32-C3 Smart Dryer**

This project is a **DIY filament dryer** designed for makers who want a **fully customizable, ESPHome-powered solution**. Unlike commercial dryers such as 3D Genius, Firos, or Dikale, this build allows you to **create your own from scratch** using an off-the-shelf storage bin, commonly available heating elements, and fansâ€”all controlled via an **ESP32-C3**.

#### **Features**

*   **ESP32-C3-Based Control Board**
    
    *   Replaces commercial controllers with an open-source, smart alternative.
        
    *   Compatible with **ESPHome and Home Assistant** for full automation.
        
*   **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**
    
    *   Real-time monitoring via a built-in **sensor**.
        
    *   Data accessible through Home Assistant or MQTT.
        
*   **Fan & Heating Element Control**
    
    *   Supports both **PWM-controlled 4-pin fans** and **standard 12V fans**.
        
    *   Intelligent heating and airflow management to ensure consistent drying.
        
    *   **Automatic safety shutoff** to prevent overheating.
        
*   **Customizable OpenSCAD Design**
    
    *   OpenSCAD files included for **mounting brackets, airflow guides, and PCB enclosures**.
        
    *   Fully parametric for easy modifications to fit different bin sizes.
        
*   **Bill of Materials (BOM) Provided**
    
    *   A complete list of **off-the-shelf parts** needed to build the dryer, including sensors, fans, and heating elements.
        
    *   Recommendations for **best filament storage bins** and insulation for optimal drying performance.
        

#### **Why Build Your Own?**

*   **More Affordable** than commercial dryers in bulk storage bin design.
    
*   **Fully Customizable** to fit different spool sizes and drying needs.
    
*   **Open Source & Upgradable** â€“ modify, improve, and integrate with your existing smart home setup.
    

This project is perfect for **makers, 3D printing enthusiasts, and DIYers** who want **more control over their filament drying process** while leveraging smart automation.
